# Amelia's Extended Research
Infinitode 2 Mod focused on Endless Research, adding 90,298 new research levels, which is an increase of 627% over the vanilla game's Endless Research.

The mod extends _ONLY_ the Endless Research, leaving the Normal Research Tree untouched. For now, the extension is limited to adding new levels to the already existing research, and slightly adjusting some of them, to make the overall research experience more enjoyable/rewarding.

## OK, but what, why, who, how, where, when, which...
__AER__ (Amelia's Extended Research, also known as the mod you're currently viewing) increases most Endless' Research maximal level to 255 (while in the vanilla game, there is only one reseach that goes that far). This essentially means that all Towers, Modifiers, Miners, and virtually all aspects of the original game get their statistics and values significantly increased.

This graphic of the Endless Research Tree illustrates it the best:

- Light blue nodes indicate limitless research (research that goes up to level 255 (and possibly beyond...))
- Red nodes show research that was changed, but which can't go up to level 255 because it would break the game (by allowing a division by 0 for example) or wouldn't make any sense (chance of something happening being bigger than 100%), which means that the research is in some way limited, but rest easy knowing that it was for a good reason
- Gold nodes indicate research that didn't change compared to vanilla

### Normal Research
This mod focuses on the Endless Research Tree, and the amount of normal research nodes affected by it is equal to 0. That means that if you want to start from a blank save, you must be prepared to play out the Infinitode 2 storyline just like you would normally

### Star Research
If you worry still about the specific order in which you have to purchase star research - don't worry, since in this mod, star research is modified so that completing all levels is able to give you the abillity of purchasing all star research

### Research Tickets (in late Endless)
You might want to get yourself a healthy supply of research tickets, since some research require more than 999M green papers, for example - a number which is impossible to get. But here research tickets come to rescue, since they bypass the research cost, thus allowing you to purchase previously inaccesible (and impossible) research levels

p.s. when I say a 'healthy supply', I do mean a _rather large_ supply, because that's the only way of purchasing _most_ (but not all) higher levels of _most_ (but not all) research

## Installation (How To/How Do I/etc.)
### 0. If you don't already, download Infinitode 2
This mod is intended for use in the Infinitode 2 game, and with any other game there is a possibility that it won't work

### 1. Creating a new instance of Infinitode 2
Go to the Infinitode 2 Steam page in your library, and go to `Settings > Manage > Browse local files`:

This should open a file explorer with a file path to a steam folder simmilar to `...Steam\steamapps\common\Infinitode 2`

Next, create a new folder anywhere in your computer - it will serve as a place in which the new instance of Infinitode will function. The name of the folder can be anything, like `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE`

Copy the contents of `...Steam\steamapps\common\Infinitode 2` into `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE`

From this repository, copy the `steam_appid.txt` into `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE`

Similarly, copy `researches.json` into `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE\res` (Windows might ask you to replace the original research file with the modified one - allow it)

If you just wanted to extend the research tree, it's done - running `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE\infinitode-2.exe` should create a new game of Infinitode 2, with no progress attached. Please note that this doesn't stop Steam from linking to your Account - I reccomend running the game in Guest mode

### 2. Moving saves to the new instance
If you want to continue your journey with Infinitode 2, but with more (possible) Research, go back to `...Steam\steamapps\common\Infinitode 2`, and copy the `...Steam\steamapps\common\Infinitode 2\saves` into `Infinitode 2 Modded AEE\saves`. This copies all of your previous progress into the modified game

### 3. Modifying an existing modded instance of Infinitode 2
If you have a already working local instance of Infinitode 2, you should be just able to copy `researches.json` into the `res` folder of your instance. However, to be able to do this, you must make sure that the mods and modifications you've done to the game didn't modify the original `research.json` file, since, if they did, pasting this mod's `research.json` might break the previously made modifications
